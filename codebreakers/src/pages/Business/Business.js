            <p>You can access important financial information and analysis tools to help you manage and improve your business. The balance sheet provides a snapshot of your business's financial health, including its assets, liabilities, and equity. You can use this information to understand your business's financial position and make informed decisions about investing, financing, and growth.

Additionally, you can view your gross profit margins, which is the percentage of revenue that remains after deducting the cost of goods sold. This metric helps you assess the profitability of your business and make pricing and cost management decisions.

There are many other financial analysis tools available in the virtual business game, such as cash flow statements, income statements, and ratio analysis. These tools can help you track your business's financial performance over time, identify areas for improvement, and make strategic decisions about how to grow and sustain your business. By regularly analyzing your business's financial information, you can gain valuable insights and make data-driven decisions that will help you achieve long-term success.</p>
